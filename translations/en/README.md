# Babel Handbook

This handbook is divided into two parts:

- [User Handbook](user-handbook.md) - How to set up/configure Babel and more.
- [Plugin Handbook](plugin-handbook.md) - How to create plugins for Babel.

If you are reading a non-english translation of this handbook you may still find
english sections that have not yet been translated. If you would like to
contribute to one of the translations you must do so through Crowdin. Please
read the [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. You
will find a number of english words that are programming concepts. If these were
translated to other languages there would be a lack of consistency and fluency
when reading about them. In many cases you will find the literal translation
followed by the english term in parenthesis `()`. For example: Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs).
